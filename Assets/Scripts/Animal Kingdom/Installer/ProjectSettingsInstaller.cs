    // using ScriptableObjectInstaller has advantages here that make it nice for settings:
    //
    // 1) You can change these values at runtime and have those changes persist across play
    //    sessions.  If it was a MonoInstaller then any changes would be lost when you hit stop
    // 2) You can easily create multiple ScriptableObject instances of this installer to test
    //    different customizations to settings.  For example, you might have different instances
    //    for each difficulty mode of your game, such as "Easy", "Hard", etc.
    // 3) If your settings are associated with a game object composition root, then using
    //    ScriptableObjectInstaller can be easier since there will only ever be one definitive
    //    instance for each setting.  Otherwise, you'd have to change the settings for each game
    //    object composition root separately at runtime
    //
    // Uncomment if you want to add alternative game settings
